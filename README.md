# Iutilitis

Common Utilities used through personal and Softuer Software work.

There is a mix of iOS, macOS and crossplatform logic here. The expectation is that most logic added to it will be
cross-platform with little to no adjustment but occasionally I'll throw in something related to an ongoing single
platform project that doesn't deserve the extra effort to make work across the apple ecosystem.

Not expected to see a particularly well organized update process. Things will be added to it as required by other work,
tests will be added as desired to ensure stability of the utilities (and when humbled by various bugs). Things will be
taken out if they prove interesting and/or useful enough to go into their own package.

Since this is a grab-bucket of things too small to deserve their own package and half-baked ideas that haven't made it
to a point where they deserve more serious development the contents here will be changing constantly. Other projects
will mostly attach to single check-ins as the stable ones.

In other words, don't even try to use this package if you're not me. Otherwise feel free to lift up any code you find
useful. Please attribute and offer feedback if you do so ðŸ™‚.
