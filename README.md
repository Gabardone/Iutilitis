# Iutilitis

Common Utilities used through personal and Softuer Software work.

They shold work for both iOS and macOS. The expectation is that most logic added to it will be cross-platform with
little to no adjustment.

Not expected to see a particularly well organized update process. Things will be added to it as required by other work,
tests will be added as desired to ensure stability of the utilities (and when humbled by various bugs).

## AutoLayout Utilities

Making life easier for developers by wrapping the most commonly used operations in utility methods.
